# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## 0.1.0

Initial public release.

- Agent loop with native and manual tool-calling modes (A/B configurable via `TOOL_CALLING_MODE`).
- Live trace dashboard (the "Observatory") with Console, Automation, Data, Memory, Developer, and
  Settings views.
- Built-in tool library: calculator, unit/currency conversion, weather, geocoding, dictionary,
  Wikipedia, crypto price, time tools, web search (SearXNG) and page fetch/crawl (Firecrawl).
- Agent-created tools (`create_tool`) and a code interpreter (`exec_python`) behind a soft,
  language-level sandbox (AST-gated restricted exec + SSRF egress guard), gated by feature flags
  and off by default.
- Approval-gated dependency installs for created tools, and an opt-in trusted-tool tier for
  human-approved unsandboxed code.
- Skills system: markdown-defined procedural knowledge on top of tools, with an optional
  deterministic `steps` block executed by the routines engine instead of free-form generation.
- Structured data: a SQL-backed table store with a safe read-only query/aggregate surface, plus
  `ask_data` (natural-language question -> SQL -> answer, with schema grounding and self-repair).
- Persistent memory with keyword and semantic (embedding-based) recall, auto-extraction, and
  configurable global/session scoping.
- Routines and a task scheduler for recurring or timed multi-step jobs.
- URL/feed watches with change alerts.
- Knowledge base (RAG) via `add_to_knowledge` / `search_knowledge` over an embedded chunk store.
- Document reader for PDF/DOCX/XLSX, including OCR for scanned PDFs.
- Charts (PNG/SVG) and dependency-free ASCII charts for inline rendering.
- Artifacts (self-contained HTML pages) and PDF export (WeasyPrint) built by the agent.
- Outbound notifications to the owner via Telegram, email (SMTP), and push (ntfy).
- Multi-model roles: separate model connections for chat vs. embeddings; works against OpenRouter,
  OpenAI-compatible APIs, or a local vLLM/Ollama server.
- `argus` CLI: `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `status`, `logs`, `run`, `version`.
